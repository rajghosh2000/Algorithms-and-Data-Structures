# Data Structures in C 
---
### Collection of Elementary Data Structures coded in c:
 - Stacks:
 	These are the simple type of Data Structures. They support the operations `push` and `pop`.They follow the LIFO(Last in First Out) Principle.They Last element to be added to the list is the first one to be removed.
 - queues
 	These are similar to Stacks ,but they follow the FIFO(First in First Out) Principle, just like what happens when we stand in queues in the real life situations.
 - linked lists
 	they are connected data structures.
    - single linked list 
    - double linked list 
    - circular linked list
